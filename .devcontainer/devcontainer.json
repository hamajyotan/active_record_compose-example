  // A known problem is that this port forwarding configuration is not working properly right after codespace is started.
  // PORTS > Visibility, change the setting that is currently /set to Private to Public, and immediately change it back to Private.
  // This behavior seems to be a bug and is reported below.
  // https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/156546

  // NOTE:
  // When the forwardPorts setting exists, port forwarding does not work properly immediately after startup.
  // As a workaround, changing the public range from Private -> Public -> Private will work, but it will work if this setting does not exist.
  // Note that this bug does not occur when using images from “mcr.microsoft.com/devcontainers/ruby” instead of
  // “ghcr.io/rails/devcontainer/images/ruby”. method provided by rails itself.
